## Overview

This repository documents practical Python exercises developed as part of an academic learning process, with a strong focus on applying fundamental concepts through problem-solving rather than theory repetition.

Each notebook is organized by topic and follows a consistent structure, allowing concepts to be explored, practiced, and documented in a clear and professional manner.

The goal is to demonstrate not only technical understanding, but also the ability to structure work, document learning, and apply best practices—skills directly transferable to real-world development environments.
