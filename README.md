# Python – Practical Exercises

A curated collection of Python notebooks showcasing hands-on practice and real application of core programming concepts.  
This repository is designed as a structured learning portfolio, emphasizing clarity, organization, and clean, readable code.

---

## Overview

This repository documents practical Python exercises developed as part of an academic learning process, with a strong focus on applying fundamental concepts through problem-solving rather than theory repetition.

Each notebook is organized by topic and follows a consistent structure, allowing concepts to be explored, practiced, and documented in a clear and professional manner.

The goal is to demonstrate not only technical understanding, but also the ability to structure work, document learning, and apply best practices—skills directly transferable to real-world development environments.
